# Real-World Security Monitoring & Threat Detection with Splunk & Security Onion

## Project Overview
I'm building a security monitoring lab using Splunk & Security Onion to detect cyber threats.
This repository contains a hands-on project demonstrating the setup, configuration, and usage of **Splunk** and **Security Onion** for real-time security monitoring and threat detection. It showcases key concepts in **SIEM**, **IDS**, **threat hunting**, and **incident response**.

## Key Features
- Deployed **Splunk** and **Security Onion** for continuous log monitoring.
- Created **SIEM alerts** for detecting cyber threats such as brute force attacks and privilege escalation.
- Simulated **real-world attacks** and demonstrated incident response.
- Documented procedures and detection rules in the **SOC Playbook** and **Incident Report**.
